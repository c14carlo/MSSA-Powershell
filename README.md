PowerShell & Bash Basics

** PowerShell (Windows, cross-platform with PowerShell Core)

** Bash (Linux, macOS, Windows via WSL)

What is a Shell?

** A shell is a command interpreter that lets you interact with your operating system by typing commands instead of clicking around with a mouse.

** Bash (Bourne Again Shell): The default on most Linux/macOS systems. Great for scripting, automation, and system administration.

** PowerShell: Microsoftâ€™s task automation framework. More object-oriented and powerful for Windows and cross-platform administration.
